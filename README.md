# personal-scripts
Just a collection of scripts I use, whether it be for Drauger OS or other stuff


Anything in `Personal` are scripts I personally use, sometimes on a daily basis.
These can be anything from my `.bashrc` file, to simple fixes for bugs on some of my hardware.

Anything in `Drauger_OS_Scripts` are scripts we use to work on Drauger OS. These are usually either dealing with
packages, or ISOs in some way.

Anything in `other` are various other scripts that I may have made for other people or as a bit of fun.
