Scripts in here are things I made for other people, or to have some fun.

`pick-distro.py` is used on BDLL to pick the new distro for the distro challenge every week.
Currently it supports a TUI and a reading from a *.txt file.

I am thinking about adding support for reading *.csv files, and reading distro names as arguments.
