Scripts in here are things I made for other people, or to have some fun.


pick-distro.py
---
`pick-distro.py` is used on [BDLL](https://bigdaddylinux.com/) to pick the new distro for the distro challenge every week.
Currently it supports a TUI and reading from a *.txt file.

I am thinking about adding support for reading *.csv files, and reading distro names as arguments. 

disk_bench.sh
---
`disk_bench.sh` is a disk benchmark tool I made for [Swivro](swivro.net). It's written in BASH so that it can run on both MacOS and Linux.
